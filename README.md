## ðŸ“š Convolution Layers in AI
Convolutional layers are a fundamental component of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used in image processing and computer vision tasks. Here are some key points:

- **Convolution Operations**: Apply filters (kernels) to input data to produce feature maps.
- **Filters/Kernels**: Learnable parameters that detect specific features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
- **Stride**: Determines the step size at which the filter moves across the input data.
- **Padding**: Adds extra pixels around the input data to control the spatial dimensions of the output.
- **Activation Functions**: Commonly used ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity.
